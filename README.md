# HexCollect
A site for sharing and tracking of health experiences as they relate to specific interventions.

The purpose of the site was to host a community where people could easily share and consume solution-centric health experiences. The idea for the site came from the book [The Wisdom of Crowds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68143).

The site flowed as follows. Users could sign up and post in three ways. A user could post about a health experience in detail including the intervention (with optional brand and dosage information), the issues and symptoms that led them to the intervention, a rating of the effectiveness of the intervention, and details regarding their experience. Users could also perform daily check-ins where they could rate and comment on their general well-being. Users could also update their own experiences with further discussion and new symptom and dosage information. Users could comment on one anothers experiences.

A users activity on the site could be viewed on their profile. The homepage of the site had the most recent posts and daily updates paginated.
